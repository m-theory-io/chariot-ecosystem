## Prepaid / Reloadable Debit Cards / Prepaid Accounts — U.S. Issuer Requirements & Constraints

These are payment‐type instruments (open-loop or semi-open) that function as a substitute for bank accounts or debit cards.

### Legal / Regulatory Regime & Scope

1. **“Prepaid Accounts Rule” (Regulation E / TILA amendments)**
   The CFPB (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) adopted a rule that brings many prepaid accounts under the protections of EFTA (Electronic Fund Transfer Act) and, in some cases, TILA (Truth in Lending) where there is a credit or overdraft feature. ([Consumer Financial Protection Bureau][1])

   * It covers payroll cards, government benefit cards, “general-use prepaid cards,” and other labeled “prepaid” accounts, unless excluded. ([NCLC Digital Library][2])
   * Issuers must provide certain disclosures, error resolution, limits on liability, and other protections. ([Consumer Financial Protection Bureau][3])
   * Issuers must submit prepaid account agreements (or changes) to the CFPB via its “Collect” system. ([Consumer Financial Protection Bureau][4])

2. **Bank Secrecy Act / AML / KYC / Customer Identification (CIP / CDD)**
   Because prepaid cards can be used to move funds, issuers (or sponsoring banks / program banks) must comply with anti‐money laundering (AML) rules. This typically means Customer Identification Program (CIP) and Customer Due Diligence (CDD) rules apply. ([FDIC][5])

   * For prepaid accounts considered accounts, banks must obtain name, date of birth, address, and identification number (e.g. SSN) and verify them via procedures. ([EVS][6])
   * There is a relatively recent **exemption** from collecting the taxpayer identification number (TIN) under CIP rules for certain account types, as granted by the banking agencies (OCC, FDIC, NCUA) with FinCEN’s concurrence. ([FDIC][7])
   * Prepaid card issuers are often considered “money transmitters” (or must partner with entities that hold money transmitter licenses) in many U.S. states. ([InnReg][8])

3. **State Licensing / Money Transmitter / Funds Holder Rules**

   * In many states, an entity that issues or reloads prepaid cards is treated like a money service business (MSB) or money transmitter, which triggers licensing, bonding, reporting, and regulatory oversight. ([InnReg][8])
   * Issuers (or their program manager) must often maintain “float” accounts in banks, segregate funds, and manage liability accounting for unused balances.
   * States may impose additional consumer protection rules (e.g. about dormancy fees, disclosures, unclaimed funds / escheat) beyond the federal baseline.

4. **Disclosure / Fee Transparency / Account Terms**
   Under the Prepaid Rule (Reg E / associated rules):

   * Issuers must provide **pre-acquisition disclosures** (or at acquisition) of all fees and material terms. ([Consumer Financial Protection Bureau][9])
   * Must clearly disclose **all** fees (not just those associated with electronic transfers), including monthly maintenance, ATM, load, inactivity, outgoing transfers, etc. ([Consumer Financial Protection Bureau][9])
   * If periodic statements are provided, they must itemize fees. ([Consumer Financial Protection Bureau][9])
   * For cards acquired before identity verification is completed (“unverified prepaid accounts”), special rules apply (e.g. limited services until verification) ([Consumer Financial Protection Bureau][10])
   * If the prepaid product includes a credit or overdraft feature (a hybrid model), then relevant TILA / Regulation Z constraints kick in. ([Consumer Financial Protection Bureau][1])

5. **Liability, Error Resolution, Loss / Theft Protections**

   * Under EFTA / Reg E as applied by the Prepaid Rule, issuers must treat unauthorized transfers, errors, and fraud similarly to other EFT accounts, subject to certain limits and conditions. ([Consumer Financial Protection Bureau][3])
   * For unverified accounts, issuers may limit liability until verification is complete, subject to prescribed limits. ([Consumer Financial Protection Bureau][10])

6. **Restrictions on “Negative” Fees or Charges**

   * The rules prohibit charging fees for replacing a prepaid card, or providing the remaining balance in some other form (unless lost or stolen). ([Legal Information Institute][11])
   * The issuer must not impose fees in a way that is misleading or hidden.
   * If a prepaid account includes a credit/overdraft functionality, fees on the “asset” side must not be more expensive (in aggregate) than for similar accounts without credit features. ([Consumer Financial Protection Bureau][9])

7. **Expiration, Dormancy / Inactivity / Service Fees**

   * For prepaid “accounts,” expiration of the underlying funds is generally not allowed (funds must remain valid).
   * Inactivity or dormancy fees may be allowed, but only after at least 12 consecutive months of inactivity, and subject to conditions (clearly disclosed, etc.). ([Consumer Financial Protection Bureau][12])

8. **Submission & Oversight**

   * Issuers are required to submit prepaid account (card) agreements and changes to the CFPB. ([Consumer Financial Protection Bureau][4])
   * The CFPB maintains guidance and compliance resources for prepaid card issuers. ([Consumer Financial Protection Bureau][13])
   * The payment networks (Visa, Mastercard, etc.) also impose network rules, standards, and compliance obligations on prepaid cards. For example, Mastercard’s rules published for 2025 contain standards applicable to prepaid cards. ([Mastercard][14])

9. **Recent Trends / Enforcement Focus in 2025**

   * Regulators are increasingly scrutinizing program managers (third parties) that control prepaid programs, requiring due diligence and compliance oversight. ([Money Laundering News][15])
   * Banks with prepaid card programs are sometimes entered into agreements with regulators to improve compliance controls (e.g. Patriot Bank). ([Money Laundering News][15])
   * There is market pressure for “no-KYC” or simplified prepaid offerings; but these are tightly constrained by AML/KYC, CIP rules, and network requirements. ([Verestro][16])

### Takeaways / Practical Obligations for an Issuer

If you intend to issue or operate a prepaid debit card program in 2025, you are likely to need to:

* Partner with or be a bank / financial institution to hold consumer funds and comply with banking laws.
* Comply with CIP / AML / KYC rules (collect identity information, verify identity, monitor for suspicious activity).
* Obtain relevant state money transmitter / MSB licenses (or contract with a licensed entity).
* Develop and maintain clear disclosures and fee transparency, continuous compliance with Reg E / CFPB’s Prepaid Rule.
* Submit your card terms / agreements to the CFPB and keep them updated.
* Design your product to address permitted fees, inactivity rules, error resolution, negative balance features, etc.
* Coordinate with payment networks to meet their operational and compliance rules for prepaid cards.

## Gift Cards / Gift Certificates — U.S. Issuer Requirements

Gift cards / gift certificates are a different category, and many of the stricter consumer protections for prepaid accounts **do not** apply to them (though some do). Here’s how they’re treated:

1. **Exclusion from the Prepaid Rule**
   Under 12 C.F.R. § 1005.20, gift certificates, store gift cards, and general-use prepaid cards (which may overlap) are expressly addressed; but many gift cards are **excluded** from the full scope of the Prepaid Rule provisions. ([Consumer Financial Protection Bureau][17])

   * The Prepaid Rule doesn’t impose all of the same obligations for gift cards (e.g. full error resolution) as for accounts. ([Federal Register][18])
   * But gift cards must still follow the specific rules in § 1005.20 (the “Gift Card Rule”) under the EFTA. ([Consumer Financial Protection Bureau][17])

2. **Key Requirements under § 1005.20 (EFTA / CFPB)**
   These are baseline federal rules governing gift cards, store gift cards, and general-use prepaid cards:

   * **No expiration within five years**
     The funds underlying a gift card cannot expire before five years from the date of activation. ([Legal Information Institute][11])
   * **Inactivity / dormancy fees restrictions**
     Inactivity or service fees cannot be imposed until the card has been inactive for at least 12 months. ([Consumer Financial Protection Bureau][12])
     Also, such fees must comply with clear disclosure requirements. ([Legal Information Institute][11])
   * **Disclosures**
     The issuer must provide certain disclosures on the card (or packaging) or at the point of sale, such as expiration date (if any), fees (if any), terms and conditions, contact information, remaining balance, etc. ([Legal Information Institute][11])
   * **No fee for replacing card or cashing out (unless lost/stolen)**
     The issuer may not charge a fee to replace the card or to provide the remaining balance in another form, unless the card was lost or stolen. ([Legal Information Institute][11])
   * **State Law Supremacy / Complement**
     The EFTA / gift card rules do *not* preempt state laws that provide *greater* consumer protection regarding inactivity fees, expiration, etc. Thus, issuers must also check state statutes. ([Consumer Compliance Outlook][19])
   * **Treatment of “general-use prepaid cards”**
     Some gift cards bear network logos (Visa, Mastercard) and can be used broadly. These are sometimes considered “general-use prepaid cards” and may have additional overlap with prepaid-account rules (or be subject to hybrid rules). ([America's Credit Unions][20])

3. **State Unclaimed Property / Escheatment / Abandoned Balances**

   * Even if federal law allows expiration after five years (or no fees for five years), state unclaimed property laws often require issuers to turn over (escheat) unredeemed balances after a shorter dormancy period (often 2–5 years). ([Alston & Bird][21])
   * Many states also have gift card–specific laws that provide stronger protections (e.g. longer validity, stricter caps on fees) than the federal baseline. ([NCSL][22])
   * Because of differing state laws, companies often “redomesticate” their gift card liability to a favorable state or use subsidiaries to localize the liability. ([Alston & Bird][21])

4. **Operational / Commercial Considerations**

   * Gift cards should clearly disclose terms, fees, expiration (if any), balance inquiry process, etc.
   * Many issuers avoid dormancy fees altogether to simplify compliance and consumer goodwill.
   * Issuers often adopt mechanisms to prevent breakage disputes, maintain reserves, track liabilities, and handle redemption / clawback issues.
   * Some states require special licensing or reporting for gift card issuers in certain circumstances.

5. **Consumer Rights / Limitations**

   * Unlike full prepaid accounts, some of the stronger protections (e.g. error resolution under EFTA, “lost card liability” limits) may not fully apply to gift cards. ([Federal Register][18])
   * If a gift card is “open-loop” (usable at merchants beyond one brand) or reloadable, parts of the prepaid rules may overlap. ([America's Credit Unions][20])

| Fees to replace card / reissue balance             | Cannot charge except for lost / stolen                                | Cannot charge except for lost / stolen                                              |
| State escheat / unclaimed property                 | Yes, must manage liability and escheat per state law                  | Yes, strong focus in gift card industry; many state laws apply                      |
| Overdraft or credit features                       | If includes credit / overdraft, additional TILA / Reg Z rules apply   | Usually not applicable (gift cards do not grant credit)                             |
| Network / card scheme / brand rules                | Yes (Visa, Mastercard, etc.)                                          | If card bears network, then those rules may apply (e.g. general-use gift cards)     |

## Can a gift card with no KYC be relaodable?

Excellent and subtle question — and the answer is **“usually no,”** with only **narrow, highly regulated exceptions.**

Here’s the breakdown for 2025 under U.S. federal and network (Visa/Mastercard) rules:

---

## 🔒 1. Regulatory Baseline: Reloadable = KYC Required

Under U.S. law (CFPB’s **Prepaid Rule**, 12 C.F.R. § 1005 et seq. and Bank Secrecy Act / FinCEN guidance):

| Concept                         | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reloadable prepaid accounts** | Are treated as “accounts” under the **Electronic Fund Transfer Act** and **Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)**.                                                                                                                                                     |
| **KYC / CIP applicability**     | Once a card is *reloadable* (can accept additional funds after sale), it becomes a **financial account**—the issuing bank or program manager must collect and verify the customer’s identifying information (name, DOB, address, SSN/TIN or equivalent). |
| **“No-KYC” cards**              | To remain exempt from CIP and “prepaid account” coverage, the product must be **non-reloadable**, **limited-use**, and **not linked to another account**.                                                                                                |

👉 **Result:** a gift card sold off-the-shelf with *no customer identification* can be loaded only **once**—at issuance.

---

## 🏦 2. BSA / FinCEN & Bank-Partner Implications

* **FinCEN 2011 Prepaid Access Rule** (31 C.F.R. § 1010.100(ww)) defines “prepaid access” systems subject to AML/KYC rules.

  * If the program allows **reloads, person-to-person transfers, or international use**, it triggers *covered-prepaid-access* status.
  * Covered programs must have a **registered program manager**, **CIP**, and **monitoring**.
* The **issuing bank** or **program sponsor** is responsible for enforcing those controls, even if the card is marketed as “anonymous.”

So a *reloadable but no-KYC* gift card would violate the BSA and expose the issuer to enforcement.

---

## 💳 3. Network Rules (Visa / Mastercard / Amex)

Both Visa and Mastercard require:

* **Full KYC** for any **reloadable prepaid product**.
* **Non-reloadable anonymous gift cards** must have hard spending limits (e.g., ≤ $500 or $1 000) and cannot be reloaded, linked to other accounts, or used for cash access.
* **Reload functionality** is available only after the user’s identity has been verified (“verified cardholder status”).

If an issuer ignores this, the network can suspend BIN privileges.

---

## ⚖️ 4. Limited / Edge Cases

A few narrow configurations *can look* reloadable without breaching the rule—but each still involves a verified entity somewhere in the chain:

1. **Corporate bulk-load systems** – An employer or merchant reloads cards on behalf of known recipients (the *employer* is the KYC’d party).
2. **Closed-loop merchant gift cards** – Reloadable *only at that merchant* and redeemable *only there*; these are excluded from many BSA obligations because funds never leave the merchant ecosystem.
3. **Government or payroll cards** – Reloadable, but the sponsoring institution performs full CIP on the recipients.

Outside those, reload + no-KYC = non-compliant.

---

## ✅ 5. Practical Summary

| Scenario                                                    | Reload Allowed?          | KYC Required?                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Single-load, store-brand gift card                          | ❌ No                     | ❌ No                                           |
| Single-load, open-loop (Visa/Mastercard) gift card          | ❌ No                     | ❌ No                                           |
| Reloadable open-loop prepaid (e.g., NetSpend, CashApp Card) | ✅ Yes                    | ✅ Yes                                          |
| Corporate reloads to employees                              | ✅ Yes (through employer) | ✅ Employer verified                            |
| Merchant closed-loop reload (same store)                    | ✅ Yes                    | ⚠️ May be exempt if funds never leave merchant |

---

**Bottom line:**

> A “no-KYC” gift card cannot legally be made reloadable with customer-initiated funds.
> Reloadability almost always flips the product into the “prepaid account” category, which mandates full CIP/KYC and AML compliance.

---

Excellent — this is where smart **product architecture** makes or breaks compliance.
Below is a 2025-level guide to **“low-friction” or “light-KYC” prepaid / gift card models** that stay within U.S. regulatory lines while still feeling user-friendly.

---

## 🧭 1. The Core Trade-Off

| Goal                                         | Constraint                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reduce friction (no long signup, no SSN)     | Cannot let consumers load or transfer funds freely             |
| Enable multiple loads or top-ups             | Must have a verified account relationship (CIP/KYC)            |
| Enable open-loop spending (Visa, Mastercard) | Must integrate with a regulated sponsor bank / program manager |
| Keep “anonymous” feel                        | Keep single-load or closed-loop and impose hard limits         |

The trick is to **segment features** by risk level — and link stronger features to verified tiers.

---

## 🧩 2. Architecture Options

### **A. Single-Load “Anonymous Tier” (True Gift Card)**

**Ideal for:** Retail shelf cards, promotional giveaways, online digital gifts.

**Features**

* One-time load (e.g., $25–$500).
* No cash access, no reloads, no person-to-person transfers.
* Cannot receive refunds or direct deposits.
* Optional online balance check (no registration required).

**Regulatory Position**

* Exempt from CIP/KYC.
* Covered by EFTA §1005.20 “Gift Card Rule.”
* Subject to state escheat laws.

**Compliance Tip**

* Market clearly as *gift card*, not *account*.
* Disable reload endpoints and any “account linking” APIs.

---

### **B. “Verified Reloadable Tier” (Full Prepaid Account)**

**Ideal for:** Everyday spending cards, neobank accounts, wage access, etc.

**Features**

* Reloadable via bank transfer, cash load, or payroll.
* Supports transfers, direct deposit, bill pay.
* May include virtual card or mobile wallet link.

**Regulatory Position**

* Must comply with Reg E “Prepaid Accounts Rule.”
* CIP/KYC required (name, DOB, address, TIN).
* AML monitoring, suspicious-activity reporting, OFAC screening required.

**Compliance Tip**

* Integrate electronic ID-verification (eIDV) vendor early.
* Submit agreement to CFPB “Collect” portal.

---

### **C. “Hybrid / Tiered-KYC Model” (Low-Friction → Verified Upgrade)**

**Ideal for:** Fintech apps seeking smooth onboarding with upgrade path.

**Mechanism**

1. **Instant issue / temp account** – user can receive a limited-value prepaid card with very small spend limit (e.g., ≤ $1,000 lifetime, ≤ $300 load per day).
2. **Upgrade path** – prompt the user to verify identity (upload ID, selfie, SSN) to unlock reloads, higher limits, P2P, etc.

**Legal Framework**

* Permitted if lower tier meets FinCEN’s “exempted prepaid access” thresholds (≤ $1,000 maximum, no international use, no P2P, no reloads by others).
* Once thresholds are exceeded or reload capability is enabled, CIP/KYC must trigger automatically.

**Compliance Tip**

* Build *automatic tier escalation*: programmatically require identity verification before enabling reload API.
* Disclose limits clearly at sign-up.

---

### **D. “Closed-Loop Reloadable” (Merchant Ecosystem)**

**Ideal for:** Starbucks, Target, Uber Cash, in-app balances.

**Features**

* Redeemable only at one merchant or a group of affiliated brands.
* Reloadable within that merchant ecosystem.
* May support auto-reload from stored payment method.

**Regulatory Position**

* **Generally exempt** from BSA/FinCEN prepaid access rules because the value never leaves the ecosystem.
* No CIP/KYC required if funds can only be spent within that network.

**Compliance Tip**

* Keep spend domain narrow (merchant or affiliate family).
* Prevent external transfers or withdrawals to stay exempt.

### **E. “Corporate Reload Model” (Known-Party Loading)**

**Ideal for:** Payroll, refunds, rebates, per-diem or travel cards.

**Features**

* Employer or corporate sponsor loads cards to known recipients.
* Individual may not load or transfer funds themselves.

**Regulatory Position**

* The *corporate sponsor* is the KYC’d entity.
* Often treated as exempt “closed-loop” or “corporate-funded” prepaid access.

**Compliance Tip**

* Restrict loading rights to the sponsoring entity.
* Maintain written agreement outlining AML responsibilities.

## ⚙️ 3. Typical Tier Design Example

| Tier              | Max Value       | KYC                                       | Features                          |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Level 0: Gift     | $500 one-time   | None                                      | Retail gift use only              |
| Level 1: Light    | $1,000 lifetime | Name + DOB + SSN last 4 (non-documentary) | Domestic spend only, no reload    |
| Level 2: Verified | $10 000 +       | Full CIP (ID upload)                      | Reloads, P2P, ATM, direct deposit |

This mirrors how modern fintechs (e.g., CashApp, Revolut, Payoneer) structure onboarding to satisfy FinCEN and network rules.

## 🧠 4. Key Implementation Practices

* **Program governance:** Bank partner must approve every feature change.
* **Transaction limits:** Enforce velocity controls (per-day / per-month loads).
* **Data segregation:** Keep anonymous and verified cardholders in separate BINs / sub-BINs.
* **Disclosure clarity:** Clearly differentiate “gift card” vs “reloadable prepaid account.”
* **Continuous monitoring:** Even anonymous tiers need fraud & sanctions screening on loads.
* **Plan for escheatment:** States may claim unused balances after 2–5 years.

## 🚀 5. Designing a “Low-Friction but Compliant” UX

1. **Instant-issue anonymous card** → load once, spend anywhere.
2. **Offer upgrade prompt:** “Verify your identity to reload and unlock more features.”
3. **Collect identity seamlessly:** Use vendor APIs (Socure, Alloy, Veriff, etc.).
4. **Switch BIN / account type after verification** (prevents cross-tier leakage).
5. **Integrate AML checks** automatically on load and spend events.

### ✅ In short

You **can** design a “light-KYC” prepaid product if you:

* Keep the *anonymous* tier **single-load / low-value / closed-loop**, **or**
* Transition users to a *verified* tier before allowing reloads or P2P.

Anything that lets a consumer **add value** to an open-loop card **without identity verification** will fail compliance under **FinCEN + CFPB + network** rules.
